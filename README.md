# Spotfire IronPython Scripts
Useful IronPython scripts for Spotfire Automation Tasks created by myself and stored here for easy retrieval

[AutoDetectResolution](https://github.com/kanungle/spotfire-ironpython/blob/main/AutoDetectResolution.py)- Useful for adjusting dashboard displays to various screen sizes. Simply create pages for each desired screen size and use page identifiers like '[M]' for mobile to display certain pages in certain screen resolution conditions

[ChangeFonts](https://github.com/kanungle/spotfire-ironpython/blob/main/AutoDetectResolution.py)- If you have a page for smaller/larger resolutions and don't want to use the default fonts, use this script to easily change all individual chart fonts on a single page.
